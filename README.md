# Time Visualized

This website is a way of visualizing the time difference between now and a point in the past and see what the difference bewteen the two is in days. I'm using React to build this application for my resume, but have been finding it more and more interesting as I keep working on it.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisities

You'll need to get Node.Js & NPM before you can start working with this project. I would also recommened nvm, for easier npm version control. You can get nvm here: https://github.com/creationix/nvm

This project is a simple React webapp using ES6 that is a great place to mess around and learn. I tried stick to the best practices as I possibly could, but I'm not perfect so I apologies if I missed anything.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

1. Clone this repo using git clone https://github.com/Light1c3/MyLifeinDays.git
2. Navigate to the project folder using `cd MyLifeinDays` (press tab to auto complete folder name).
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies needed.
3. Run `npm start` to see the compiled app at http://localhost:3000.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Light1c3/MyLifeinDays.git
$ cd ./MyLifeinDays
$/MylifeinDays npm install

[intsalling]

$/MyLifeinDays npm start

```

## Deployment

To get a devolyable build, use `npm run build` which will create a build folder with the deployed version.
